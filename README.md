# Blinkit-Dashboard-
Creating a Blinkit Dashboard in Power BI involves designing an interactive report to showcase KPIs like total sales, customer ratings, and inventory trends. It uses visualizations such as line charts, bar graphs, to provide insights into sales performance, outlet efficiency, and customer behavior. The dashboard is customizable with filters, slicers, and drill-downs for in-depth analysis and decision-making.

Use Power BIâ€™s visual tools to design charts and graphs:
Line Chart: For sales trends over time.
Bar/Column Chart: For sales by product category.
Pie Chart: For customer ratings distribution.
Table/Matrix: For detailed data like sales and inventory figures.
Cards: For showing KPIs like total sales or average ratings.
